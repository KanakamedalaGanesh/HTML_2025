Headings : Headings are titles or subtitles that is displayed in a larger or bolder font to indicate the structure of the content. They help organize the content and make it easier to read. In HTML, headings are defined using the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags, where `<h1>` is the highest level heading and `<h6>` is the lowest level heading.
// Headings are used to create a hierarchy of content, allowing users to quickly understand the main topics and subtopics of a webpage.
// Headings are important for search engine optimization (SEO) as they help search engines understand the structure and relevance of the content on a page.
// Headings can also improve accessibility by providing a clear structure for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
// Headings can be styled using CSS to change their appearance, such as font size, color, and spacing.
There are six levels of headings in HTML, with `<h1>` being the most important and typically used for the main title of a page, while `<h6>` is used for the least important subheadings.


Paragraphs : Paragraphs are blocks of text that are used to convey information or ideas. They are typically used to group related sentences together, making the content easier to read and understand. In HTML, paragraphs are defined using the `<p>` tag.
// Paragraphs are used to break up large blocks of text into smaller, more manageable sections.
// Paragraphs can be styled using CSS to change their appearance, such as font size, line height, and margins.
// Paragraphs can also include other HTML elements, such as links, images, and lists, to enhance the content.
// Paragraphs are important for readability and user experience, as they help to organize content and make it more visually appealing.



//Both headings and paragraphs are block-level elements in HTML, meaning they start on a new line and take up the full width available. 
They can be nested within other elements, such as `<div>` or `<section>`, to create a structured layout for the content.

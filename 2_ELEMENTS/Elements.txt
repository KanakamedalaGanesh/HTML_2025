Elements in HTML: AN HTML element is defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag.
// Elements can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
// Elements can be nested within other elements to create a hierarchy of content.
// Some common HTML elements include:
// 1. `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings, where `<h1>` is the highest level and `<h6>` is the lowest.
// 2. `<p>`: Paragraphs, used to define blocks of text.
// 3. `<a>`: Anchor tags, used to create hyperlinks to other pages or resources.
// 4. `<img>`: Image tags, used to embed images in a webpage.
// 5. `<div>`: Division tags, used to group content together for styling or layout purposes.
// 6. `<span>`: Span tags, used to apply styles to a portion of text without breaking the flow of content.
// 7. `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists, used to create lists of items.
// 8. `<li>`: List items, used within `<ul>` or `<ol>` to define individual items in a list.
// 9. `<table>`: Table tags, used to create tabular data.
// 10. `<tr>`: Table row tags, used to define rows within a table.
// 11. `<td>`: Table data tags, used to define individual cells within a table row.
// 12. `<form>`: Form tags, used to create interactive forms for user input.
// 13. `<input>`: Input tags, used to create various types of form fields such as text boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
// 14. `<button>`: Button tags, used to create clickable buttons in forms or interactive elements.
// 15. `<label>`: Label tags, used to define labels for form elements. 

Types of Elements:
// 1. Block-level elements: These elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, and `<ul>`.
// 2. Inline elements: These elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.
// 3. Self-closing elements: These elements do not have an end tag and are closed with a forward slash in the start tag. Examples include `<img />`, `<br />`, and `<hr />`.
// 4. Semantic elements: These elements provide meaning to the content they contain, improving accessibility and SEO. Examples include `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>`.   
// 5. Interactive elements: These elements allow user interaction and can include form elements like `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<select>`. They are essential for creating dynamic web applications.
// 6. Multimedia elements: These elements are used to embed media content such as images, audio, and video. Examples include `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>`. They enhance the user experience by providing visual and auditory content.
// 7. Scripting elements: These elements are used to include scripts in the HTML document, such as JavaScript. The `<script>` element is commonly used for this purpose.
// 8. Meta elements: These elements provide metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and SEO information. The `<meta>` element is used for this purpose.
// 9. Link elements: These elements are used to link external resources, such as stylesheets or icons, to the HTML document. The `<link>` element is commonly used for this purpose.
// 10. Style elements: These elements are used to define CSS styles directly within the HTML document. The `<style>` element is used for this purpose, allowing for quick styling without external stylesheets.
// 11. Comment elements: These elements are used to add comments within the HTML code, which are not displayed in the browser. The syntax for comments is `<!-- comment -->`. Comments are useful for leaving notes or explanations within the code without affecting the rendered content.
// 12. Template elements: These elements are used to define reusable HTML structures that can be cloned and inserted into the document using JavaScript. The `<template>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to create dynamic content without cluttering the main HTML structure.
// 13. Data elements: These elements are used to store custom data attributes that can be accessed via JavaScript. The `data-*` attribute allows developers to attach additional information to HTML elements without affecting the standard attributes. For example, `<div data-user-id="123">` can be used to store a user ID that can be accessed later in a script.
// 14. Progress elements: These elements are used to display the progress of a task, such as file uploads or downloads. The `<progress>` element is used for this purpose, providing a visual representation of the completion status.
// 15. Meter elements: These elements are used to represent a scalar measurement within a known range, such as disk usage or battery level. The `<meter>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to display real-time data in a user-friendly format.
// 16. Time elements: These elements are used to represent dates and times in a machine-readable format. The `<time>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to specify the date and time of events, which can be useful for SEO and accessibility.
// 17. Address elements: These elements are used to provide contact information for the author or owner of the document. The `<address>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to include relevant contact details in a structured format.
// 18. Figure elements: These elements are used to encapsulate media content, such as images or videos, along with their captions. The `<figure>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to group related content together for better organization and accessibility.
// 19. Figcaption elements: These elements are used to provide captions for the content within a `<figure>` element. The `<figcaption>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to add descriptive text to media content.
// 20. Details elements: These elements are used to create expandable and collapsible sections of content. The `<details>` element is used for this purpose, allowing users to reveal or hide additional information as needed.
// 21. Summary elements: These elements are used to provide a summary or title for the content within a `<details>` element. The `<summary>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to create interactive sections that can be expanded or collapsed by the user.
// 22. Dialog elements: These elements are used to create modal dialogs or pop-up windows. The `<dialog>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to create interactive dialogs that can be opened and closed programmatically.
// 23. Slot elements: These elements are used in Web Components to define placeholders for content that can be filled in later. The `<slot>` element is used for this purpose, allowing developers to create reusable components with customizable content.
